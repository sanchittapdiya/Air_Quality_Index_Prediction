# Air_Quality_Index_Prediction
It predicts the Air quality index , the data used is scrapped from web with the help of a python program , then that data is used to predict using different machine learning algorithms. 
Motivation : https://youtu.be/CTu0qnuMxgA
In this project
First we are scaping Air quality data from a website using web scrapping methord and from these html pages we taken table data for our need. After handling missing data, these data are analylzed using different visualization methord in python, then the data is used to perform predictions using different machine learning methords , like linear regression,ridge and lasso regression , decision trees ,etc.
